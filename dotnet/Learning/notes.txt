Every executable C# application must contain a class defining a Main() method which is used to signify the entry point of the application

The Main() method can be defined in any class within the application, but then you have to specify the class name when you run the application

You could alter the Main() method to return a value, where a value of 0 indicates success and a -1 indicates failure.
